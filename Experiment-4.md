**Experiment 4**

*Create the /home/consultants directory. Add write permission to the consultants directory. Use the symbolic method for setting the appropriate permissions. Forbid others from accessing files
in the /home/consultants directory. Use the octal method for setting the appropriate permissions. Change the default umask for the operator1 user. The new umask prohibits all access for users
that are not in their group. Confirm that the umask is changed.*
