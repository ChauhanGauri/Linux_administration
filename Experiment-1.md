**Experiment 1**

*Use the touch command to create sets of empty practice files to use during this lab. In each set replace, replace X with the numbers 1 through 6. Create six files with names of the form songX.mp3, snapX.jpg and filmX.avi. Create three subdirectories for organizing your files and name the subdirectories friends, family and work. Use a single command to create all three subdirectories at the same time. Approach- Use the touch command with brace expansion to create the files and the mkdir command with space-separated names to create the directories.*
